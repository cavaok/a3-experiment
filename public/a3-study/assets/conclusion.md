## Study Completion

You have successfully completed the Relationship Perception Experiment. Thank you for your valuable contribution!

## Study Purpose and Methodology

This experiment was designed to test how effectively people can perceive relationships between variables when presented with different visualization types:

1. **Traditional scatterplots**: The most direct representation of correlation between two variables.
2. **Bubble scatterplots**: Similar to traditional scatterplots but with an additional variable encoded as point size, which may interfere with correlation perception.
3. **Heatmaps**: An alternative way to visualize density and correlation patterns.

Each trial contained two visualizations with different correlation strengths. By measuring your accuracy across different visualization types, we can determine which techniques are most effective for communicating relationships in data.

## How Your Data Will Be Used

Your responses will help us understand:
- Which visualization types make relationship perception easier or more difficult
- How confidently people can judge correlations using different visualization techniques
- Whether certain visualization types are more prone to misinterpretation

This information is valuable for creating more effective data visualizations in fields ranging from science and business to public health and journalism.
