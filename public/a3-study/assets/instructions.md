# Experiment Instructions

## Overview

In this experiment, you will be shown pairs of visualizations side by side. Your task is to select the visualization that shows a **stronger relationship** between variables.

## What is a "Stronger Relationship"?

A stronger relationship means the variables are more closely connected and predictable from one another. Visually:

- In a **strong relationship**, points or data tend to follow a clear pattern (usually forming a line or curve)
- In a **weak relationship**, points or data appear more scattered or random

If you need a reminder of what a strong vs weak relationship looks like check out this demonstration by [Kristoffer Magnusson from R Psychologist](https://rpsychologist.com/correlation/)

## Visualization Types

You'll encounter three types of visualizations:

### 1. Traditional Scatterplots
- Each point represents one data point
- X-axis and Y-axis show the two variables
- Stronger relationships have points clustered more tightly along a pattern

### 2. Bubble Scatterplots
- Similar to traditional scatterplots
- The size of each bubble represents a third variable
- Focus on the X-Y relationship (position), not the size

### 3. Heatmaps
- Color intensity shows data density
- Darker colors indicate more data points in that region
- Stronger relationships show a clearer color pattern from one corner to another

## Task Instructions

For each trial:

1. **Examine both visualizations** carefully
2. **Type which visualization (1 or 2)** in the sidebar that you believe shows the stronger relationship between variables
3. **Rate your confidence (1 through 5)** in your choice using the sidebar on the following screen

## Tips

- Trust your visual perception!
- Don't spend too long on each question because your initial impression is valuable
- There is no time limit, but the experiment typically takes 5-10 minutes to complete
