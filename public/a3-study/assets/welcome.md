# Welcome to the Relationship Perception Experiment

Thank you for participating in this study on how people perceive relationships between variables in different visualization types.

## What You'll Be Doing

In this experiment, you will be shown pairs of visualizations side by side. Your task is to identify which visualization shows a **stronger relationship** between the variables.

You'll encounter three types of visualizations:

1. **Traditional Scatterplots**: Simple X-Y plots showing the relationship between two variables.
2. **Bubble Scatterplots**: Similar to traditional scatterplots but with a third variable encoded as size.
3. **Heatmaps**: Showing the density of points across the X-Y space through color intensity.

## The Experiment Process

The experiment consists of:
- Instructions explaining each visualization type
- Multiple visualization comparison trials
- Confidence ratings after each selection

Each trial will involve:
1. Viewing two visualizations
2. Selecting the one that shows a stronger relationship
3. Rating your confidence in your selection

## Important Notes

- There are no trick questions â€“ one visualization in each pair will have a genuinely stronger relationship than the other.
- Trust your visual perception rather than trying to calculate exact values.
- Please take your time with each question, but don't overthink your responses.
- The entire experiment will take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete.
